## Initialisation

#### HTML

Start with a standard select box you want to convert:

```html
<select id="mySelect">
	<option vlaue="value-1">Value 1</option>
	<option vlaue="value-2">Value 2</option>
	<option vlaue="value-3">Value 3</option>
	...
</select>
```

#### Javascript

You can then instantiate Selectr by passing a reference to your select box as the first parameter as either a DOM node or a CSS3 selector string:

```javascript
new Selectr(document.getElementById('#mySelect'));

// or

new Selectr('#mySelect');
```

Selectr accepts the options object as a second parameter:

```javascript
new Selectr('#mySelect', {
	searchable: false,
	width: 300
});
```
