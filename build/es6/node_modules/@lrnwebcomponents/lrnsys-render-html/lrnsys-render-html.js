`lrnsys-render-html`
A legacy element which just directly renders HTML.
WARNING: DO NOT USE THIS UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!

This element is meant to render html from a source that has already been sanitized.
Polymer will, by design, not render html for security reasons. This element gets around
that. Do not render raw user input through this element! This would allow XSS attacks for
your users.
