// this is where you can loop in your own custom elements for inclusion in the build routine
// it's important to note that by running polymer build in the main repo (or in a site)
// you are taking the training wheels off a bit and really doing custom development on top of HAXcms
// HAXcms seeks to be hands off and for anyone to be empowered without the need for running commands
// however you're free to expand on the capabilities and use it for publishing PWAs that are HAX capable faster
